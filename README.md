Use the OpenWeatherMap API to create a representative model of weather across world cities.
The objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

1. Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
2. Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
3. Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
4. Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
